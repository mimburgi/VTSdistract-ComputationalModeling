\description{
Hierarchical Bayesian Modeling of choice/reaction time data with the following parameters: "alpha" (boundary separation), "beta" (bias), "delta" (drift rate), "tau" (non-decision time). 
The code is based on codes/comments by Guido Biele, Joseph Burling, Andrew Ellis, and potentially others @ Stan mailing 

\strong{MODEL:}
Ratcliff drift diffusion model - multiple subjects. Note that this implementation is \strong{not} the full drift diffusion model as described in 
Ratcliff (1978). This implementation estimates the drift rate, boundary separation, starting point, and non-decision time, but not the between- 
and within-trial variances in these parameters.
}
\details{
This section describes some of the function arguments in greater detail.

\strong{data} should be assigned a character value specifying the full path and name of the file, including the file extension 
(e.g. ".txt"), that contains the behavioral data of all subjects of interest for the current analysis. 
The file should be a \strong{tab-delimited} text (.txt) file whose rows represent trial-by-trial observations and columns 
represent variables. For choice/reaction-time tasks, there should be three columns of data with the labels "subjID", "choice", and "RT". 
It is not necessary for the columns to be in this particular order, however it is necessary that they be labelled 
correctly and contain the information below:
\describe{
 \item{\code{"subjID"}}{A unique identifier for each subject within data-set to be analyzed.}
 \item{\code{"choice"}}{An integer representing the choice made on the current trial. Lower/upper boundary or left/right choices should be coded as 1/2 (e.g., 1 1 1 2 1 2).}
 \item{\code{"RT"}}{A floating number the choice reaction time in \strong{seconds}. (e.g., 0.435 0.383 0.314 0.309, etc.).}
}
\strong{*}Note: The data.txt file may contain other columns of data (e.g. "stimulus_name", "trial_number", etc.), but only the data with the column
names listed above will be used for analysis/modeling. As long as the columns above are present and labelled correctly,
there is no need to remove other miscellaneous data columns.
 
\strong{nwarmup} is a numerical value that specifies how many MCMC samples should not be stored upon the 
beginning of each chain. For those familiar with Bayesian methods, this value is equivalent to a burn-in sample. 
Due to the nature of MCMC sampling, initial values (where the sampling chain begins) can have a heavy influence 
on the generated posterior distributions. The \strong{nwarmup} argument can be set to a high number in order to curb the 
effects that initial values have on the resulting posteriors.  

\strong{nchain} is a numerical value that specifies how many chains (i.e. independent sampling sequences) should be
used to draw samples from the posterior distribution. Since the posteriors are generated from a sampling 
process, it is good practice to run multiple chains to ensure that a representative posterior is attained. When
sampling is completed, the multiple chains may be checked for convergence with the \code{plot(myModel, type = "trace")}
command. The chains should resemble a "furry caterpillar".

\strong{nthin} is a numerical value that specifies the "skipping" behavior of the MCMC samples being chosen 
to generate the posterior distributions. By default, \strong{nthin} is equal to 1, hence every sample is used to 
generate the posterior. 

\strong{Contol Parameters:} adapt_delta, stepsize, and max_treedepth are advanced options that give the user more control 
over Stan's MCMC sampler. The Stan creators recommend that only advanced users change the default values, as alterations
can profoundly change the sampler's behavior. Refer to Hoffman & Gelman (2014, Journal of Machine Learning Research) for 
more information on the functioning of the sampler control parameters. One can also refer to section 58.2 of the  
\href{http://mc-stan.org/documentation/}{Stan User's Manual} for a less technical description of these arguments.
